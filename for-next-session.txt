Bug #0001
Title: Unhandled Error in nit
Description: When you input a location that is not in the database,
             the program errors with this:
                `Error: missing field `results` at line 1 column 32`
How to replicate: 
    - run `init` (cargo run -- init)
    - When asked for location (i.e. 'What's you current location?'),
        write gibberish or even a highly-specific place
    - Program receives no results from API
    - `results` field is therefore not present
