#0001 (v.0.4.0)     BUG
STATUS: Ready to be worked on
DESC:   `open` doesn't accurately open today's entry.  Instead, it opens a 
    new file with today's date _and time_.  As the file name for the previous 
    entries will obviously have a time stamp in the past, it will create a 
    new empty entry and open it instead.
SOLN:   This can be removed by changing the behaviour of `open`.  Instead of 
    opening creating a new time stamp and opening the file at that time stamp,
    the new `open` func may
        - Store today's DATE 
        - Scan the directory for entries in today's DATE
        - If there is not display a message;
        - If there's only one, open it;
        - If there's multiple, show the file name of each entry;
        - The user will select the entry via index entry
