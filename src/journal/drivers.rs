const MESSAGE_GREETING_CONFIG_INIT: &str = r#"

--Welcome to journal_CLI!--

This command-line interface app is here to help you document your thoughts,
experiences, and ideas effortlessly.  Let's get you started :)

For this part, we'll set your defaults.
"#;

const MESSAGE_LOCATION_EXPLAINER: &str = r#"
We'll only need your usual location.  

We use your default location to automatically detect your default timezome and 
to detect the current weather.  This will also be printed in your entries.  
To ensure the best results, make sure that the last part of your location is 
somewhere that is specific enough for accurate timezone and weather data.

Don't worry---if your city has the same name as a city elsewhere,
like Los Angeles, Los Santos or San Francisco, Cebu,
you would be asked to pick which city you meant.

Example:
- Avenida 9 SO - Carchi, Guiyaquil
- Lor Marzuki, Singapore City
- CafÃ© What?, Moshoeshoe Rd, Maseru
"#;

const MESSAGE_EDITORS_EXPLAINER: &str = r#"
This application does not use its own text editors and will separately run 
a text editor of your own choosing, like vim, nano, and emacs.
